Hi and !hello!


  1st thint is makeing someting like virtual paper 
but before that u need to upload library (import tkinter as tk)


  paper:
u can take any name i always take root idk why lol.
so u need to type "any name = tk.Tk()"

u did it, cool

  obiect(button, label, entry[input]):
it is usually the same
any name = tk.[Button, Label, Entry]((your tk.Tk() name), text="opcional", bg="main color is opcional", fg="text color is also opcional")

important!!!
  oneed to pack everythink for example button.pack() if u wont do that think wont show up 
and "the tk.Tk()" name in my program root loock    root.mainloop() it is holding all program to not vanish

i think that it is all.

  code for u to learn:

import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()

btn = tk.Button(root, text="button")
btn.pack()

root.mainloop()

other with funkcion 

import tkinter as tk

def click():
    label.pack_forget()

def clickh():
    label.pack()
    root.after(350, click)

root = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(root, text="click")

btn = tk.Button(root, text="button", command=clickh)
btn.pack()

root.mainloop()

have nice learning :)
